SMOK
====
(c) P.W. DMS s.c. 2009-2010

This is first version of SMOK system, written in 2009, in the era where it used an Atom server and a SOHO internet access with IP changing daily (no-ip rulez).

This was stripped of any corporate secrets in order to be posted online.

Please note that this is very legacy code, sinning plentifully against PEP8. This is only meant as a curiosity.

Waiting for release, in some very very far future, are SMOK2 and SMOK3. 

Current version, SMOK4, uses very elegant code and design, something entirely unlike it. Beware :>
